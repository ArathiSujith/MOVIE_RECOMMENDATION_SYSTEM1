# MOVIE_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM

I'm excited to share my latest project where I built a Movie Recommendation System using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy! ðŸš€

ðŸ“Š Data Exploration:
I started by analyzing a movie rating dataset, which contained information about user ratings for different movies. After importing the data and performing some data exploration, I found the top-rated movies and those with the most ratings.

ðŸ“Š Visualizing the Data:
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created insightful histograms and joint plots to better understand the relationship between movie ratings and the number of ratings a movie received. These visualizations revealed some interesting trends!

ðŸ’¡ Building the Recommendation Engine:
To personalize movie recommendations, I created a movie rating matrix. The matrix allowed me to identify movies that are highly correlated with each other based on user ratings. By leveraging the correlation, I could recommend similar movies to users.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommending Movies:
For example, when users watch "Star Wars (1977)," the system suggests other movies that have a high correlation with it. Similarly, when users watch "Liar Liar (1997)," the system provides recommendations based on the correlation with this movie.

ðŸ’¡ Next Steps:
In the future, I plan to enhance the recommendation engine by incorporating machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering or matrix factorization. This will further improve the accuracy and personalization of movie recommendations.

I'm thrilled with the results of this project, and I believe it showcases the power of Python for data analysis and building intelligent systems.
